A browser based js miner based on Bitcoin-Javascript-Miner


What is it?
-----------

This is a Bitcoin Miner implemented in JavaScript. 
Originally by [progranism](https://github.com/progranism/Bitcoin-JavaScript-Miner), improved by [kr105rlz](https://github.com/kr105rlz)
and [cmaclell](https://github.com/cmaclell/Bitcoin-JavaScript-Miner). I modified its structure moderately. 


Can it mine bitcoins ?
----------------------

With current difficulty level, no. This miner achives 50Kh/s on my intel i7 quadcore. The performance can be improved, but will not be enough to profitably mine bitcoins. 

Intended Usage 
--------------

Its main purpose is to act as a learning tool and micro web miner. Feel free to browse the commented source-code and learn more about how Bitcoins are mined.
